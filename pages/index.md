## Research Vision

Our lab aims to improve therapeutics for underrepresented communities by
investigating the influence of genetic ancestry on molecular signatures
in the brain. We use computational tools and disease-relevant models
such as postmortem brain tissues, brain organoids, iPSC-derived glial
cells to uncover how genetic ancestry impacts complex traits in the brain.
This integrative approach provides insights into the interplay between
genetic and environmental factors in complex brain disorders.

We collaborate with the community to direct our efforts in the development
of impactful research. Therefore, one of the main focuses of our lab is
to train a diverse group of next-generation computational scientists
with the ability to communicate our findings with the community.
