At the <ins>H</ins>ealth <ins>E</ins>quity for <ins>A</ins>dvancing
<ins>R</ins>esearch and <ins>T</ins>echnology using
<ins>Ge</ins>nomic <ins>N</ins>euroscience (HEART-GeN) lab, our
goal is to improve treatments for brain disorders with health disparities.
While 99.99% of our genome is shared across global ancestral population,
the very small fraction unique to a specific ancestral population
can effect how genes turn on or off. We use this human variation
to find these genes that may play a role in explain health
disparities for brain disorders.
