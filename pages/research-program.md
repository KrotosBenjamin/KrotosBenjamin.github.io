## Research Vision

We envision a future where prevention and treatment of neurological disorders
are grounded in a deep, causal understanding of the immune–vascular–brain axis
-- and designed inclusively from the start. Our lab brings together
foundation-scale machine learning and experimental biology to move from
prediction to intervention.

Our active-learning loop starts with interpretable, uncertainty-aware models
that nominate candidate regulatory circuits. We test these directly in human
organoids and isogenic iPSC-derived glial and vascular cells. The experimental
results then feed back into the models, helping distinguish causal biology from
correlation and surfacing clinically actionable mechanisms.

Over the next decade, this platform will deliver three field-defining resources:

1. A publicly validated atlas of causal regulatory programs across disease stages and ancestries;
2. Portable biomarkers of immune–vascular dysregulation to enable patient stratification;
3. A translational pipeline that turns noncoding variation and RNA processing events into first-in-class therapeutic targets.

We are equally committed to transforming how this science is done. Our
infrastructure embeds inclusion and rigor, from prospectively defined ancestry
and sex representation thresholds to GPU-accelerated, FAIR-compliant analysis
pipelines that others can adopt.

Through open resources and the training of a diverse, cross-disciplinary
workforce fluent in both computation and experiment, we aim to convert
immune–vascular biology into precision, population-informed interventions
-- reducing disparities while accelerating therapies that benefit everyone.

## Research Interests

### Genetic ancestry in the brain

In neuroscience and genomics, individuals with recent African ancestry (AA)
account for less than 5% of large-scale research cohorts for brain disorders
but are 20% more likely to experience a major mental health crisis.
Furthermore, divergent responses to antipsychotics between AA and European
ancestry (EA) have been linked to genetic differences. Understanding these
genetic and/or regulatory differences between AA and EA in the human brain,
is essential to the development of effective neurotherapeutics and
potentially could decrease health disparities for neurological disorders.

### Schizophrenia
#### Caudate nucleus and schizophrenia
Most studies of gene expression in the brain of individuals with schizophrenia
have focused on cortical regions. However, subcortical nuclei such as the
striatum are prominently implicated in the disease, and current antipsychotic
drugs target the striatum’s dense dopaminergic innervation.

#### Sex differences and schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with sexually dimorphic
features, including differential symptomatology, drug responsiveness, and male
incidence rate. To date, only the prefrontal cortex has been studied in
large-scale transcriptome analyses for sex differences in schizophrenia.

### Neurodegeneration

Neurodegenerative disorders disproportionately impact underserved
communities, yet the molecular mechanisms that drive this imbalance remain
poorly understood. Our lab is expanding into neurodegeneration research to
investigate how genetic ancestry shapes vulnerability to age-related cognitive
decline and neuroinflammation. By integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic
datasets from postmortem brain tissues and patient-derived models, we aim to
identify ancestry-aware biomarkers and therapeutic targets that can inform
precision medicine approaches for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.
We welcome collaborations that help accelerate this work and amplify its
impact for diverse communities.

### Collaborations

#### Angiotensin II receptors in the human lung

Understanding the precise distribution and function of angiotensin receptors
within the lung is crucial for developing effective treatments for lung diseases
like COPD and IPF. Here, our goal is to provide a foundational framework by
mapping the expression patterns of *AGTR1* and *AGTR2* across different lung cell
types and identifying their involvement in specific disease states. Our findings
will offer new insights into the complex role of the renin-angiotensin system in
lung health and disease, paving the way for targeted therapeutic interventions.
