<!-- title: "HEART-GeN Research Program" -->
<!-- description: Dr. Kynon Benjamin leads the HEART-GeN group in three main areas of neuroscience research: (1) genetic ancestry in the brain, (2) schizophrenia, and (3) software development. -->

## Research Vision

Our lab aims to improve therapeutics for underrepresented communities by
investigating the influence of genetic ancestry on molecular signatures
in the brain. We use computational tools and disease-relevant models
such as postmortem brain tissues, brain organoids, iPSC-derived glial
cells to uncover how genetic ancestry impacts complex traits in the brain.
This integrative approach provides insights into the interplay between
genetic and environmental factors in complex brain disorders.

We collaborate with the community to direct our efforts in the development
of impactful research. Therefore, one of the main focuses of our lab is
to train a diverse group of next-generation computational scientists
with the ability to communicate our findings with the community.

## Research Interests

### Genetic ancestry in the brain

In neuroscience and genomics, individuals with recent African ancestry (AA)
account for less than 5% of large-scale research cohorts for brain disorders
but are 20% more likely to experience a major mental health crisis.
Furthermore, divergent responses to antipsychotics between AA and European
ancestry (EA) have been linked to genetic differences. Understanding these
genetic and/or regulatory differences between AA and EA in the human brain,
is essential to the development of effective neurotherapeutics and
potentially could decrease health disparities for neurological disorders.

### Schizophrenia
#### Caudate nucleus and schizophrenia
Most studies of gene expression in the brain of individuals with schizophrenia
have focused on cortical regions. However, subcortical nuclei such as the
striatum are prominently implicated in the disease, and current antipsychotic
drugs target the striatum’s dense dopaminergic innervation.

#### Sex differences and schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with sexually dimorphic
features, including differential symptomatology, drug responsiveness, and male
incidence rate. To date, only the prefrontal cortex has been studied in
large-scale transcriptome analyses for sex differences in schizophrenia.

### Neurodegeneration

Neurodegenerative disorders disproportionately impact underserved
communities, yet the molecular mechanisms that drive this imbalance remain
poorly understood. Our lab is expanding into neurodegeneration research to
investigate how genetic ancestry shapes vulnerability to age-related cognitive
decline and neuroinflammation. By integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic
datasets from postmortem brain tissues and patient-derived models, we aim to
identify ancestry-aware biomarkers and therapeutic targets that can inform
precision medicine approaches for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.
We welcome collaborations that help accelerate this work and amplify its
impact for diverse communities.

### Collaborations

#### Angiotensin II receptors in the human lung

Understanding the precise distribution and function of angiotensin receptors
within the lung is crucial for developing effective treatments for lung diseases
like COPD and IPF. Here, our goal is to provide a foundational framework by
mapping the expression patterns of *AGTR1* and *AGTR2* across different lung cell
types and identifying their involvement in specific disease states. Our findings
will offer new insights into the complex role of the renin-angiotensin system in
lung health and disease, paving the way for targeted therapeutic interventions.
