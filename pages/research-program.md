## Research Vision

Our lab aims to improve therapeutics for underrepresented communities by
investigating the influence of genetic ancestry on molecular signatures
in the brain. We use computational tools and disease-relevant models
such as postmortem brain tissues, brain organoids, iPSC-derived glial
cells to uncover how genetic ancestry impacts complex traits in the brain.
This integrative approach provides insights into the interplay between
genetic and environmental factors in complex brain disorders.

We collaborate with the community to direct our efforts in the development
of impactful research. Therefore, one of the main focuses of our lab is
to train a diverse group of next-generation computational scientists
with the ability to communicate our findings with the community.

## Research Interests

### Genetic ancestry in the brain

In neuroscience and genomics, individuals with recent African ancestry (AA)
account for less than 5% of large-scale research cohorts for brain disorders
but are 20% more likely to experience a major mental health crisis.
Furthermore, divergent responses to antipsychotics between AA and European
ancestry (EA) have been linked to genetic differences. Understanding these
genetic and/or regulatory differences between AA and EA in the human brain,
is essential to the development of effective neurotherapeutics and
potentially could decrease health disparities for neurological disorders.

### Schizophrenia
#### Caudate nucleus and schizophrenia
Most studies of gene expression in the brain of individuals with schizophrenia
have focused on cortical regions. However, subcortical nuclei such as the
striatum are prominently implicated in the disease, and current antipsychotic
drugs target the striatum’s dense dopaminergic innervation.

#### Sex differences and schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with sexually dimorphic
features, including differential symptomatology, drug responsiveness, and male
incidence rate. To date, only the prefrontal cortex has been studied in
large-scale transcriptome analyses for sex differences in schizophrenia.

### Software development

#### dRFEtools: dynamic recursive feature elimination for omics

Technology advances have generated larger ‘OMICs datasets with applications
for machine learning. Even so, sample availability results in smaller sample
sizes compared to features. Dynamic recursive feature elimination (RFE)
provides a flexible feature elimination framework to tackle this problem.
*dRFEtools* provides an interpretable and flexible tool to gain biological
insights from ‘OMICs data using machine learning.

### Collaborations

#### Angiotensin II receptors in the human lung

**Rationale**: The renin-angiotensin system is one of the most well characterized
integrative pathways in humans and is known to contribute to a variety of common
disorders such as hypertension, chronic renal disease, and heart failure. The
wide availability of agents targeting this pathway has led to an expansion of
its clinical spectrum to lung disorders. Despite this widespread interest,
specific localization of this receptor family in the vertebrate lung is limited.
One reason is due to the general imprecision of the available antibody
reagents.\
**Goal**: Use publicly available single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing to identify
and characterize patterns of angiotensin II receptor expression in the lung at
different ages.
