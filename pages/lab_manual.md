# Welcome to the HEART-GeN Lab

Welcome to the Health Equity for Advancing Research and Technology using
Genomic Neuroscience (HEART-GeN) lab! As a member of the HEART-GeN lab,
you\'re choosing to join a group of diverse scientists. Our lab focuses
on **developing more equitable treatments** for brain disorders that
disproportionately affect Black communities. In this lab manual, you\'ll
learn more about the lab\'s mission and values, as well as key
information about getting started, working, and getting help in the lab.
Just remember, you\'re a valued member of the team and you belong here
just as much as anyone else!

# What the HEART-GeN Lab is About

## Our Scientific Mission and Vision

Our lab aims to improve therapeutics for underrepresented communities by
investigating the influence of genetic ancestry on molecular signatures
in the brain. We use computational tools and disease-relevant models,
such as postmortem brain tissues, brain organoids, and iPSC-derived
glial cells to uncover how genetic ancestry impacts complex traits in
the brain. This integrative approach provides insights into the
interplay between genetic and environmental factors in complex brain
disorders.

We collaborate with the community to direct our efforts in the
development of impactful research. Therefore, one of the main focuses of
our lab is to train a diverse group of next-generation computational
scientists with the ability to communicate our findings with the
community.

## Our Values

As an interdisciplinary group, our lab values team science that
prioritizes three core elements of *scientific excellence*:

1.  **Rigor, Reproducibility, and Transparency:** We are committed to
    conducting **honest research** that adheres to the highest standards
    of scientific integrity. We acknowledge the challenges inherent in
    research, but believe that transparency, open communication, and
    meticulous methodology are essential for generating reliable and
    impactful findings.
2.  **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion:** We believe that **diverse
    perspectives and backgrounds** are essential for achieving
    scientific breakthroughs. We foster a welcoming and inclusive
    environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute
    their unique talents and expertise. This dedication to diversity
    strengthens our research and broadens our understanding of the
    world.
3.  **Mentoring and Collaboration:** We believe in fostering a culture
    of **mentorship and collaboration**. We are dedicated to providing
    support, guidance, and learning opportunities to all members of our
    lab, regardless of their experience level. We value open dialogue,
    constructive criticism, and teamwork as essential elements for
    achieving scientific progress.

# Communication in the HEART-GeN Lab

## General Communication Policies

Open, honest, and respectful communication is essential within our lab.
As such, I expect all members of the HEART-GeN lab to treat others with
respect. This means to treat others the way they want to be treated, not
withholding information, and listening carefully.

## Meetings in the Lab

Our lab has several types of recurring meetings.

### Team Meetings

This is a weekly team meeting to discuss research going on in the lab.
Every team member is expected to attend. During these meetings, every
scientific team member will prepare a three-slide outline: (1) previous
work, (2) current work, (3) next steps. The first slide will give an
overview of the progress the team member has made in the previous week.
The second slide will discuss what the team member is planning on doing
in the current week. The last slide will discuss future plans and any
problems they have encountered.

Administrative staff may give updates on any administrative tasks or
goals that the lab should be made aware of, including outreach efforts
and any budgetary concerns.

These meetings will be scheduled at the beginning of each semester to
maximize in-person attendance of all team members. Food will be provided
during this meeting. Expected time is one hour, not to exceed 75
minutes. A hybrid option will be available for all team meetings
automatically.

### One-on-One Individual Meetings

One-on-One meetings with Dr. Benjamin will be scheduled weekly for
trainees and biweekly for staff (research and administrative). For
trainees, these meetings will be to discuss research progress and
professional development. Trainees should expect to spend **at least 15
minutes** discussing professional development activities and goals.

### Project-specific Meetings

Every project has a project-specific meeting to discuss project related
issues. This could include, but is not limited to, data preparation,
data acquisition, data storage, and project design. These hour-long
meetings will be divided into three parts: (1) project updates, (2)
project concerns or problems, and (3) expected timeline for project
deliverables.

A project deliverable may include:

-   Paper
    -   Data acquisition
    -   Data preparation
    -   Data analysis
    -   Writing and/or Editing
-   Software
    -   Development
    -   Annotation
    -   Release
    -   Maintenance
-   Resource / Dataset
    -   Development
    -   Maintenance
    -   Release

### As-Needed Meetings

Beyond the regular scheduled meetings, we encourage open communication
and collaboration through as-needed meetings. These meetings can be:

-   One-on-one meetings: If you encounter a problem, have questions, or
    need guidance, feel free to request a meeting with me directly. This
    allows for focused discussions and personalized support.
-   Team meetings: If an issue would benefit from the collective
    expertise of the lab, or a collaborative brainstorming session, an
    additional team meeting can be scheduled.
-   Project-specific meetings: When launching a new project, we will
    schedule a dedicated meeting to discuss roles, procedures, and
    ensure everyone is on the same page. This helps ensure a smooth and
    coordinated start.
-   Data-focused meetings: Complex data analysis or manuscript
    discussions may require dedicated time beyond the regular team
    meeting. Feel free to propose a meeting with relevant team members
    to delve deeper.

I encourage all team members to take initiative and request these
meetings as needed.

## Communication Tools Used in the Lab

-   Email: main form of non-research related communication
-   Slack: informal communication for quick responses
-   GitHub (via [issues](https://github.com/features/issues)): research
    related communication
-   Video chat/Phone call/text: for meetings and/or communications that
    need to happen quickly

# Getting Started in the HEART-GeN Lab

## On-boarding

As a new team member, you will go through an on-boarding process to
become acquainted with the team, projects, programming environment, and
expectations. You can expect:

-   Introductions and meetings with team members
-   Training on programming, record-keeping, and institutional
    compliance
-   Overview of current research projects and collaborative partnerships
-   Review of lab policies, procedures, and documentation practices
-   Discussion of your goals, interests, and professional development
    plan

## General Guidance for New Team Members

Getting started in a new environment will take time. We don\'t expect
everyone to be up and running within a week! In general, new team
members can expect it to take about a month to get all on-boarding tasks
complete. Depending on your starting knowledge, a new team member might
spend several months learning basic computational skills and reading
papers. There is no rush! Here, at the HEART-GeN lab, we believe a
strong foundation takes time and everyone learns at different rates.

## New Team Member Essentials

### HR information

*Some things that might be included: parking information, location of*
*restrooms (gender neutral), policies about food in the lab, etc.*
*Where people can put their lunch, personal items, etc. Note where/how
to get* *their identification badge, keys, required paperwork, web-based
systems (e.g.,* *HR systems or compliance system) or other essential
tools. Indicate how to* *access the lab calendar, website, etc.*

### Lab culture

Headphones are required during normal work hours. Normal work hours are
Monday to Friday from 0800 to 1800. Outside of those hours, please be
respectful for your fellow team members.

## New Team Member On-boarding Tasks

### First-day tasks

-   Computer setup
-   High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster access
-   Lab-specific software access
-   Joining Slack
-   Read lab manual

    -   [Open Source Framework](https://osf.io/dashboard) (OSF)

**Note:** If you do not have a GitHub, we will work together to create
one for you.

## Materials to Review

During the first couple of months of joining the lab, review material
will be tailored by project and experience. For example, if a new team
member has limited programming experience, they will focus their time on
learning basic programming. In addition to this, new members can expect
to get a bundle of papers, protocols, and technical manuals that are
specific to their project. During our one-on-one meetings, we will build
a realistic time frame for building programming, statistics, and linear
algebra, which is necessary for all projects in the lab. It is
**always** okay to ask for more background materials, even if they do
not directly relate to your assigned project.

# Working in the HEART-GeN Lab

## Expectations of Lab Members

### What You Should Expect from Me as Principal Investigator

As the Principal Investigator (PI) of the HEART-GeN lab, my role is
leading our group to get research accomplished. What that means is:

-   I write grants to fund our work
-   I manage, supervise, and provide timely feedback on
    -   research activities
    -   manuscripts
    -   data management
-   I initiate and manage collaboration to further our research impact

In addition to this role, I am also your mentor. I am committed to
working with every team member so that they are working toward their
personal goals. This will be tailored to each individual member.
However, everyone will learn or refine critical thinking, management,
and mentorship skills during their time in the HEART-GeN lab.

**Tips for Working with Me:**

-   If I\'m more than 5 minutes late to our scheduled meeting, please
    send a Slack message. I may have become distracted, but I haven\'t
    forgotten!
-   As a neurodivergent person, I may not make eye contact. Rest
    assured, I am still actively listening to you!
-   There are times when I experience sensory overload. During these
    moments, I\'ll wear noise-canceling headphones and keep my office
    door shut. If you have an urgent matter or a question during this
    time, please reach out to me via Slack.

### What I Expect from Lab Members

I expect you to:

-   Learn how to think critically
-   Learn how to present and document your research findings to the
    community
-   Be responsive to feedback
-   Ask questions when you need clarification
-   Treat lab members with respect

    someone who enjoys working alongside others, fostering a supportive
    and productive lab environment.
-   **Reliability and Accountability:** We value team members who
    consistently deliver high-quality work and take ownership of their
    responsibilities. You can be counted on to meet deadlines and follow
    through on commitments.

## Record-Keeping

Computational research relies on clear and accurate documentation to
ensure reproducibility and scientific progress.

### Standardized Format

In our group, all notebooks include standard sections: background, goal
(objective and hypotheses), study design, methods, results (including
negative or inconclusive), and interpretation. For computational
projects, methods will include the general approach and associated code
blocks. This also means including relevant figures and tables to
illustrate your findings.

For record-keeping we will be using text files that are written using a
combination of Markdown, LaTeX, and Jupyter notebooks. This primarily
implemented with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

### Using Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs)

Our group uses ELNs. This facilitates efficient data entry,
organization, and collaboration. ELNs offer advantages such as version
control, searchability, and accessibility from multiple devices.

Our lab uses [Open Source Framework](https://osf.io/dashboard) (OSF) as
our ELN system. This is a free, open source, platform that connects to
GitHub and reference management system (Zotero). Getting access and
training is part of [*On-boarding*](#getting-started-in-the-heart-gen-lab).

### Document All Procedures and Protocols

Document all computational procedures, protocols, and scripts used in
data analysis or software development. Include details such as parameter
settings, software versions, and any modifications made during the
process. We have specific code blocks for Python and R to help output
session information, which will include software versions.

In our group, we document negative or inconclusive results, as they can
be valuable for future research.

### Record Data Inputs and Outputs

Record all data inputs and outputs generated during computational
experiments or simulations. Document the source of input data,
processing steps, and resulting outputs to ensure transparency and
reproducibility.

### Maintain Detailed Metadata

Include detailed metadata alongside computational datasets, specifying
information such as experimental conditions, data sources, preprocessing
steps, and quality control measures. This metadata enhances the
understanding and usability of the datasets.

### Implement Version Control Systems

Implement version control systems (e.g., Git) for managing code
repositories and tracking changes in computational scripts and software.
Regularly commit code updates and provide descriptive commit messages to
facilitate collaboration and reproducibility.

### Backup Data Regularly

We have regular backup procedures for computational data, code, and
analysis results to prevent data loss in case of hardware failures or
accidents. This is a quarterly backup data, but individual team members
should regularly backup their work computers to the HPC.

### Document Computational Workflows

In addition to individual project codes, we also generate computational
workflows and pipelines used for data processing, analysis, and
visualization. For all workflows and pipelines, a flowchart or diagram
illustrating the sequence of operations and dependencies between
different components should be created.

### Ensure Data Security and Privacy

Adhere to data security and privacy regulations when handling sensitive
or confidential information. Implement encryption, access controls, and
other security measures to safeguard computational datasets and research
findings.

### Regularly Review and Validate Entries

We hold monthly code review sessions that are part of the entry
validation process. This will ensure that electronic records are
accuracy, completeness, and consistent. Anyone and everyone can have a
small bug in their code, so these sessions are apart of our teams peer
review and collaborative efforts to identify potential errors or
discrepancies.

### Provide Clear Attribution and Acknowledgment

Provide clear attribution and acknowledgment for all contributors to
computational projects, including data providers, software developers,
and collaborators. Acknowledge funding sources and grants that support
the research. For example, if using a public dataset, make sure to
include any needed acknowledgment in your notebook. For working with
code in a Git repository, remember to fork the original repository to
help keep track of attributions. This type of code notation will be part
of your training.

## Data

In our lab, we hold transparency, integrity, and collaboration as core
values in data collection, management, and sharing. The following
describe the expectations of all team members for [*data
management*](#data-management). By adhering to
the following expectations, we ensure responsible data management
practices that contribute to the advancement of our research and foster
a collaborative environment within the lab. If you have any questions or
require further clarification, please don\'t hesitate to discuss them
with the Dr. Benjamin.

### Data Collection and Management

**Documentation:** Team members are expected to record all aspects of
their data collection process, including methodologies, equipment, and
data cleaning steps ([*Record-Keeping*](#record-keeping)).

**Metadata, File Naming, and Organization:** Team members must create
comprehensive metadata, including descriptions of data sources,
variables, and preprocessing steps. File naming conventions should be
clear, consistent, and descriptive to facilitate easy identification and
retrieval of data. Organize data into logical folders and subfolders
based on projects, experiments, or datasets.

**Version Control:** Adopt version control systems like `Git`
for managing code scripts, analysis pipelines, and documentation. Team
members are required to commit code updates regularly, provide
informative commit messages, and maintain separate branches for
development and production environments.

### Data Storage and Security

**Data Storage:** Data should be stored securely in designated locations
to prevent loss or unauthorized access. Team members are required to
store their data on local platforms. Local storage should include secure
network drives or servers designated by the lab. Some team members will
be leading new data processing, raw data are required to be stored on
both local and cloud storage.

**Data Backup:** Regular and automated data backups are mandatory to
safeguard against data loss. Team members must ensure that data backups
are performed consistently and stored in secure locations.

**Access Control:** Access to lab data should be restricted to
authorized personnel only. Team members are responsible for maintaining
the confidentiality and security of lab data and should not share access
credentials with unauthorized individuals.

**Data Ownership and Access Upon Departure:** Team members retain
ownership of the data they generate during their tenure in the lab. Upon
leaving the lab, individuals are expected to transfer ownership of their
data to Dr. Benjamin or designated successor. Access to lab data will be
revoked for departing members to maintain data security. However,
anonymized datasets may be retained for future reference with Dr.
Benjamin\'s approval. Additionally, an agreement for secure data
transfer can be arranged with a data use agreement.

### Data Ownership and Sharing

**Transparent Data Sharing:** Transparent data sharing within the lab,
particularly with the Dr. Benjamin, is essential for fostering
collaboration and ensuring research integrity. All team members are
expected to share their data with the Dr. Benjamin regularly and
proactively, providing updates on progress, challenges, and findings
(see [*Meetings in the Lab*](#meetings-in-the-lab)).

**Data Use Agreements (DUAs):** For collaboration outside the lab, DUAs
should be established outlining permitted uses and attribution
requirements. In turn, we must also comply with any DUAs associated with
external datasets or collaborations. Before accessing or using external
data sources, team members are responsible for reviewing and adhering to
the terms and conditions specified in the DUAs. Any questions or
concerns regarding DUAs should be addressed with Dr. Benjamin or the
team member\'s designated supervisor. Our lab maintains a list of
external data with DUAs attached to help with this.

**Long-Term Archiving:** We deposit anonymized data in public
repositories following institutional policies, ensuring long-term
accessibility for future research. Team members should consult with Dr.
Benjamin or designated data steward to determine the most suitable
archiving platform and procedures for their datasets.

### Data Management Tools and Practices

**Electronic vs. Physical Documents:** Whenever possible, team members
should prioritize electronic documentation (e.g., `OSF`) over
physical documents to facilitate accessibility, sharing, and version
control. Physical documents should be digitized and uploaded to
`OSF`.

**Data Visualization Tools:** Data visualization tools enable our team
to explore, analyze, and communicate research findings effectively.
Visualization software such as `matplotlib`
(`Python`) or `ggplot2` (`R`) can be
used to create informative graphs, charts, and interactive dashboards
(`plotly` or `shiny`) for presenting data
insights. Our use of ELNs and `jupyter` means that
visualization is built within our notebooks.

**Collaboration and Communication Tools:** Collaboration and
communication tools such as Slack or Zoom facilitate real-time
communication and project coordination among team members. In addition
to these tools, we use GitHub issues to monitor project milestones,
including project coordination, management, and communication. Team
members should use these tools in addition to `OSF` to
streamline collaboration, exchange ideas, and coordinate research
activities effectively.

**Training and Support:** Team members will receive training and support
in using data management tools effectively. The lab will provide
resources, workshops, and documentation to familiarize team members with
the tools and practices adopted by the lab, enabling them to harness the
full potential of these tools in their research endeavors.

## Professional Development

Our lab is committed to supporting your professional development and
career goals. We recognize the importance of continuous learning and
skill development for success in research. We expect all team members to
actively pursue professional development throughout their time in the
lab. This could involve attending workshops, seminars, or conferences
relevant to your goals.

### Individual Development Plans

An Individual Development Plan (IDP) serves as a personal strategic
roadmap for achieving job-related, career-oriented, and professional
development goals. They are valuable career resources, assisting team
members mapping out their career trajectories and taking crucial initial
steps to achieve their goals.

The IDP has five steps:

1.  **Define career objectives and competencies:** This means
    identifying a career path by exploring different job options. In
    doing so, you can get a list of skills needed to achieve that goal.
2.  **Self-assessment to identify areas of growth:** Evaluate current
    strengths and areas for improvement.
3.  **Compare and contrast for areas of growth:** What is missing in
    your experience and training?
4.  **Set achievable goals:** Make concrete plans to improve your skills
    with short- and long-term career goals.
5.  **Monitoring, Assessing, and Adapting IDP:** Regularly review and
    update the IDP to reflect progress, changing circumstances, and
    evolving career aspirations.

Create your IDP at <http://myidp.sciencecareers.org>.

### Scientific Writing

Scientific writing is a life long journal of improvement. As such, our
lab prioritizes continued education on scientific writing. This includes
hosting a weekly writing accountability group (WAG) for the lab. All
trainees will be expected to attend at least one scientific writing
workshop and/or course. Additionally, a writing session will be
organized as part of our annual retreat.

### Science communication

As part of all team members development, Dr. Benjamin will host an
annual presentation workshop. This will be tailored to the team member
make-up. However, it will always include poster presentations (i.e., 60
sec, 5 min, 15 min) and oral presentations (i.e., 3 min, 10 min, or 45
min). It may also include job talks and general science communication.

Before any major presentations, team members will be expected to
practice with Dr. Benjamin during a [*one-on-one
meeting*](#one-on-one-individual-meetings),
followed by at least one group practice during the weekly [*team
meetings*](#team-meetings).

### Conferences

Attending conferences may be an essential component of a team members
professional development. Depending on the location, national
conferences can be expensive to attend. All team members can expect Dr.
Benjamin to find resources to attend one national conference every two
years. These may include leveraging university or departmental
resources. Therefore, it is important that team members identify
conferences at their annual performance review to plan accordingly. Dr.
Benjamin encourages attending local conferences annual as part of
scientific communication training.

## HEART-GeN Lab Policies

### Work Hours

We balance productivity, well-being, and flexibility while ensuring that
essential tasks are completed in a timely manner. As such, we have a
hybrid, flexible policy.

**Core Hours:** Team members are expected to be available for
collaborations, meetings, and communications from 0900 to 1800. This is
depend on team dynamics and project requirements (i.e., collaborator in
a different time zone). In general, team members can expect Dr. Benjamin
to communicate during these core hours.

**Flexible Schedule:** We offer flexibility in work hours to accommodate
individual preferences and personal commitments, such as family
obligations or commute constraints. Schedules are adjustable as long as
team members meet their work responsibilities and communicate
effectively with other team members.

**Expected Work Hours:** As part of academia the needed working hours to
complete projects will ebb and flow. To promote a healthy work-life
balance and prevent burnout, full-time team members are encouraged to
work no more than 160 hours a month. While this is roughly 40 hours a
week, the allocation of these hours is flexible. Undergraduate and high
school team members should work no more than 10 hours a week during the
school year.

**Remote Work Options:** We embrace remote work as a primarily
computational lab. Fully remote team members will be expected to attend
the annual lab retreat. Travel and accommodations for this retreat will
be provided by the lab.

**Breaks and Rest Periods:** It is important to take regular breaks and
rest periods throughout the workday to prevent fatigue and maintain
productivity. Please remember to step away from your screens, stretch,
and recharge periodically -- every hour if you can manage it.

**Monitoring and Support:** We provide support and resources to help our
team members manage their workloads effectively. This includes regularly
monitor work hours, workload distribution, and individual well-being to
identify any signs of excessive stress or overwork. Please do not
hesitate to use a personal/mental health day when you need one.

**Feedback and Evaluation:** This is a working policy. As such, we will
be continuously evaluating its effectiveness with regard to team members
work hours, schedule flexibility, and overall satisfaction with the
policy. We will use this feedback to refine and improve the work hour
policy to better meet the needs of the team.

### Time Off

In our lab, open communication and mutual respect are fundamental
principles when it comes to requesting time off. Here\'s how team
members should inform Dr. Benjamin about their need for time off:

**Notification Process:** Team members should notify Dr. Benjamin of
their intention to take time off as soon as they become aware of the
need. While emergencies may necessitate immediate communication, for
planned time off, team members should aim to provide notice well in
advance to allow for proper planning and coordination.

**Preferred Channels:** Lab members can inform Dr. Benjamin of their
time-off requests through a variety of communication channels, including
email or Slack. An in-person communication should be follow by either an
email or Slack message for Dr. Benjamin\'s record keeping. Regardless of
the communication method, clarity and professionalism are expected.

**Expectation of Time Away:** Team members are encouraged to take time
away from the lab as needed to prioritize their well-being, personal
obligations, and professional development. The lab culture supports a
healthy work-life balance, and members should feel empowered to take
time off when necessary without fear of judgment or reprisal.

**Flexibility and Understanding:** Dr. Benjamin understand that
unforeseen circumstances may arise, and team members may need to adjust
their schedules or take time off on short notice. While advance notice
is preferred, Dr. Benjamin am committed to being flexible and
accommodating when feasible, provided that lab activities can continue
smoothly and deadlines can be met.

**Dissuading Time Off:** While Dr. Benjamin recognize the importance of
taking time off for self-care and personal responsibilities, there may
be instances where urgent deadlines, critical experiments, or team
commitments necessitate the postponement of planned time off. In such
cases, Dr. Benjamin will communicate openly with team members,
explaining the rationale behind the request to defer time off and
seeking to find mutually acceptable solutions.

**Planning Ahead:** To ensure that lab activities can continue smoothly
during a member\'s absence, Dr. Benjamin encourages team members to plan
ahead and delegate tasks or responsibilities as necessary. By
proactively identifying potential bottlenecks or dependencies in
projects, team members can minimize disruptions and facilitate a
seamless transition during their time away.

**Setting a Tone of Self-Care:** Dr. Benjamin strives to set a positive
tone around the importance of self-care and work-life balance. By
modeling healthy behavior and prioritizing his own well-being, Dr.
Benjamin aims to create a supportive and inclusive environment where
team members feel valued, respected, and empowered to prioritize their
own needs.

In summary, team members are encouraged to communicate openly and
proactively about their time-off needs, with advance notice preferred
whenever possible. While taking time off is encouraged, there may be
instances where flexibility is required to accommodate urgent lab needs.
Through open communication, understanding, and mutual respect, we can
foster a culture of well-being and productivity in our lab.

### Code of Conduct

In our lab, we uphold a code of conduct to maintain a safe, respectful,
and productive work environment. While some expectations may seem
implicit, it\'s essential to make them explicit to ensure clarity and
consistency across the team.

This Code of Conduct is a living document and may be subject to revision
as needed. We believe that by adhering to these principles, we can
create a thriving research environment that fosters innovation,
collaboration, and ethical research practices.

Here are the expectations regarding various aspects of lab conduct.

    -   Research integrity policies
    -   [*Responsible Conduct of Research*](#responsible-conduct-of-research)

### Performance Reviews

Our lab prioritizes continuous feedback and professional development for
all team members. We recognize that research trainees and staff have
different needs and timelines, so we use different approaches to
performance reviews.

1.  Research Trainees (degree holders)

    Research trainees include postbaccalaureate (postbacs), graduate
    students, and postdoctoral fellows.

    **Frequency:** We conduct formal reviews at least annually, often
    coinciding with a trainees thesis committee meetings and/or annual
    [*Individual Development Plans*](#individual-development-plans). This is adjusted for each
    trainee based on their Mentoring Agreement.

    **Format:** Reviews will involve a discussion based on your IDP
    goals, progress made, and any areas requiring further development.
    We may also include program-specific review forms, depending on
    departmental requirements. Prior to scheduling committee meetings,
    all trainees will have a one-on-one specific to reviewing progress
    and professional development.

    **Criteria:** Reviews will focus on research progress, publication
    record, scientific communication skills, laboratory skills,
    scientific writing skills, and trainee-specific professional
    development goals.

    **Who Conducts Reviews:** Dr. Benjamin will conduct initial reviews
    alone. Other committee members will conduct a separate review during
    thesis committee meetings.

2.  Research Trainees (non-degree holders)

    In addition to postbacs, graduate students, and postdoctoral
    fellows, undergraduate and high school level research trainees will
    also have annual or seasonal performance reviews.

    **Summer trainees:** For trainees who are with the lab for a summer,
    Dr. Benjamin will conduct a review during the exit interview (see
    [*Leaving the Lab*](#leaving-the-lab)). This
    informal review tracks research progress, scientific communication
    and writing skills, and trainee-specific professional development
    goals.

    **Undergraduate trainees:** Dr. Benjamin will conduct a review after
    every academic semester. This formal review tracks research
    progress, scientific communication and writing skills, computational
    skills, and trainee-specific professional development goals.

    **High school trainees:** Dr. Benjamin will conduct a quarterly
    review (every three months). This informal review tracks research
    progress, computational skills, scientific communication, and
    trainee-specific professional development goals.

3.  Lab Staff

    **Frequency:** Formal reviews will be conducted annually, following
    institutional policies and procedures. These reviews typically occur
    around the anniversary of the employee\'s start date.

    **Format:** Reviews will use the standard university staff
    performance review form. The review process will include a
    combination of self-assessment, supervisor evaluation, and input
    from peers and collaborators that interact with the team member on a
    regular basis.

    **Criteria:** Performance criteria for university employees may be
    based on job responsibilities, key performance indicators, and
    competencies outlined in the standard performance review form
    provided by the university. These criteria often include areas such
    as job knowledge, quality of work, communication skills, teamwork,
    and professional development.

    **Who Conducts Reviews:** Dr. Benjamin will conduct reviews,
    potentially in consultation with other team members who work closely
    with the staff member being reviewed.

4.  Additionally Considerations

    In addition the above performance reviews, team members will get
    weekly regular input and feedback on their work and progress during
    [*One-on-One Individual Meetings*](#one-on-one-individual-meetings). Furthermore, reviews are
    additional opportunities to discuss training needs and opportunities
    for skill development.

### AI/ML in the Lab

Our lab uses both artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in
our research. Our goal is to foster responsible, ethical, and
transparent use of AI/ML in our research. We have some guiding policies
to ensure that AI/ML contributes positively to our scientific process.

1.  Choosing AI/ML Tools

    **Alignment with Research Goals:** AI/ML tools should be selected
    based on their suitability to address specific research questions
    and objectives.

    **Transparency and Explainability:** Give preference to AI/ML tools
    with transparent algorithms or mechanisms that allow for
    understanding the rationale behind model outputs.

    **Bias Considerations:** Be mindful of potential biases present in
    AI/ML algorithms and datasets used during research. Implement
    strategies to mitigate bias where possible.

    **Security and Privacy:** Choose AI/ML tools that meet appropriate
    security standards and prioritize data privacy.

2.  Responsible AI/ML Research Practices

    **Data Quality:** Ensure the quality and relevance of data used for
    training and evaluating AI/ML models. Address issues of data
    completeness, accuracy, and potential biases.

    **Documentation and Code Sharing:** Document AI/ML workflows
    thoroughly, including code, training procedures, and model
    hyperparameters. Consider sharing code openly when possible to
    facilitate reproducibility and collaboration.

    **Model Validation and Testing:** Rigorously test and validate AI/ML
    models to assess their performance, limitations, and potential for
    generalizability.

    **Interpretation and Context:** Interpret outputs of AI/ML models
    critically, considering their limitations and potential for errors.
    Provide appropriate context for AI/ML-generated findings within the
    overall research framework.

    **Ethical Considerations:** Be mindful of the ethical implications
    of AI/ML research. Consider potential societal impacts and
    unintended consequences of AI/ML applications.

3.  Responsible Authorship and Credit

    **Attribution:** Clearly define the role of AI/ML tools within the
    research process. Acknowledge contributions of both AI/ML algorithms
    and the researchers who developed or applied them.

    **Authorship:** Assign authorship based on significant contributions
    to the research project. Researchers who develop, train, or
    interpret AI models should be appropriately recognized. AI does not
    meet our requirements for authorship, given the need for
    accountability. AI and large language models (LLM) tools may not be
    listed as an author on any of our scholarly work. AI and LLM must be
    acknowledged if used to generate figures or in the writing process.
    Team members using AI and LLM are accountable for the accuracy,
    integrity, and originality of their work.

4.  Communication and Reporting

    **Transparency:** Be transparent about the use of AI/ML in research
    projects. Communicate limitations and uncertainties associated with
    AI/ML models.

    **Public Communication:** When communicating research findings
    derived from AI/ML, clearly explain the role of AI/ML and its
    limitations to avoid misleading interpretations.

5.  Responsible Use of AI Resources

    **Computational Resources:** Use computational resources efficiently
    when using AI/ML models. Explore options for reducing resource
    consumption where possible.

    **Open Source Contribution:** Consider contributing to open-source
    AI/ML frameworks and datasets whenever feasible.

    **Software Licensing:** Comply with all software licensing terms and
    conditions when using AI/ML tools.

6.  Monitoring and Review

    **Updating Policy:** This policy will be reviewed and updated
    periodically to reflect advancements in AI/ML technology and
    evolving best practices.

    **Reporting Concerns:** If a team member has any concerns regarding
    the use of AI/ML within the research group, please inform Dr.
    Benjamin.

### Leaving the Lab

As a member of the HEART-GeN lab, Dr. Benjamin strives to create a
supportive and enriching environment where team members can thrive and
achieve their scientific goals. As part of that process, team members
may eventually move on to pursue exciting new opportunities. While Dr.
Benjamin hopes that departures are primarily voluntary and planned, he
understands that members may need to leave involuntarily. This policy
outlines expectations for both planned and unforeseen departures.

1.  Planned Departures

    **Graduations:** For students graduating, please inform Dr. Benjamin
    of your expected departure date well in advance. This discussion
    will be monitored during one-on-one meetings as part of professional
    development.

    **Voluntary Separation:** If you decide to leave the lab for another
    position, please inform Dr. Benjamin within at least 6 weeks of
    notice. The six weeks of notice is so that projects and publications
    can be managed.

2.  Unforeseen Departures

    In the rare event that a team member needs to be asked to leave the
    lab involuntarily, it will be done with careful consideration and in
    accordance with established procedures. This could be due to:

    **Performance or Behavior Issues:** Performance or behavioral
    concerns will be addressed directly with the team member by Dr.
    Benjamin. A corrective action plan will be developed, and if
    concerns are not addressed, involuntary departure may be necessary.
    This decision will be based on documented instances of performance
    or behavior issues that have been discussed with the member and have
    not been resolved.

    **Project Funding:** Research funding can sometimes end
    unexpectedly. In such circumstances, Dr. Benjamin will make every
    effort to place you in another research opportunity within the lab
    or connect you with alternative research positions. However, if no
    suitable options are available, involuntary lab departure due to
    funding limitations may be necessary. Dr. Benjamin will give four
    months of notice if possible in this situation.

3.  General considerations

    **Data and Records:** While the goal at the HEART-GeN lab is to keep
    well organized data, one month before planned departure research
    data and protocols should be up-to-date on OSF. Additionally, Dr.
    Benjamin will schedule extra meetings to ensure proper archiving and
    handover of project materials.

    **Ongoing Projects:** Ongoing projects will be discussed with Dr.
    Benjamin and other team members to determine the best course of
    action for completion or continuation.

    **Publications:** Prepare to continued collaborations with Dr.
    Benjamin and your co-authors to complete submissions of any
    manuscripts in progress. The goal for all trainees would be to have
    first author manuscripts submitted before departures.

    **Communication:** Open and transparent communication is key. Please
    discuss any questions or concerns regarding your departure from the
    lab with Dr. Benjamin as soon as possible. The more time notice is
    given the better as Dr. Benjamin can potentially offer career
    advancement within the HEART-GeN lab or help with outside career
    advancement. When you succeed, the HEART-GeN lab succeeds.

# Troubleshooting and How to Get Help

## Making and Disclosing Mistakes and/or Problems

Mistakes happen. What matters is how we respond to them. In the
HEART-GeN lab, we value a culture of open communication and believe that
disclosing mistakes, even difficult ones, is important for ensuring
scientific integrity.

### Making Mistakes

Everyone makes mistakes, including Dr. Benjamin! The important thing is
to learn from them and take steps to prevent them from happening again.
If you make a mistake, **don\'t panic!**

1.  **Take a Breath and Assess:** Take a moment to compose yourself and
    assess the situation. Consider the potential impact of the mistake.
2.  **Stabilize the Situation:** If possible, take steps to prevent the
    mistake from causing further problems.
3.  **Get Help:** Don\'t hesitate to seek help from Dr. Benjamin or
    another team member with experience. We are here to support each
    other.
4.  **Address Mistake:** Address any immediate consequences of the
    mistake. This might involve re-running code or documenting the
    error.
5.  **Disclose the Mistake:** Come forward and honestly explain the
    mistake to Dr. Benjamin as soon as possible. Transparency is key to
    maintaining trust and taking corrective steps.
6.  **Learn and Teach:** We\'ll analyze the mistake together to
    understand what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening
    again. We will share this learning experience with the team to
    benefit everyone.

### Problems Happen (Not Necessarily Mistakes)

Sometimes, problems happen that aren\'t anyone\'s fault. For example
software version changes that break a computational pipeline or a
software update on the computing cluster has unexpectedly interrupted an
analysis. The key is to communicate and collaborate to find solutions.
If a problem happens, you can follow the above steps (2-6) to help
troubleshoot.

## Resolving Conflicts (with peers or PI)

Conflicts also happen! Working closely with diverse personalities and
perspectives can sometimes lead to disagreements. Even so, conflict does
not need to be a negative force. When handled constructively, it can
spark creativity and lead to better outcomes.

### Conflict in the lab

**It\'s Inevitable:** We all have different backgrounds, work styles,
and approaches. Disagreements are bound to happen, and that\'s okay.

**Focus on Solutions:** The key is to focus on finding solutions rather
than dwelling on the problem itself. Approach conflict as an opportunity
to learn from each other and improve communication.

**Diversity is a Strength:** Remember the our lab thrives on the unique
perspectives and skills each team member brings. Embrace these
differences and see them as assets to overcome challenges and achieve
better results.

### My Expectations for Conflict Resolution

**Open Communication:** The most important tool for resolving conflict
is clear and respectful communication. Actively listen to each other\'s
viewpoints and express your own concerns constructively.

**Focus on the Issue:** Keep the discussion focused on the specific
issue at hand, avoiding personal attacks or blame games.

**Willingness to Compromise:** Be prepared to find common ground and
explore solutions that work for everyone involved.

**Seek Help if Needed:** If you\'re struggling to resolve a conflict
with a team member, don\'t hesitate to come to Dr. Benjamin for guidance
or mediation.

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

Here are some strategies that can be helpful when navigating conflict:

**Schedule a Calm Discussion:** Take some time to cool down before
addressing the issue. Schedule a dedicated time to talk things through
calmly and rationally.

**Active Listening:** Truly listen to the other person\'s perspective
without interrupting. Try to understand their concerns and motivations.

**\"I\" Statements:** Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and
needs without placing blame. For example, \"I feel frustrated when...\"
instead of \"You always...\"

**Brainstorm Solutions:** Work together to brainstorm potential
solutions that address everyone\'s concerns. Be open to creative
approaches.

Remember, conflict can be a catalyst for positive change. By following
these principles and practicing open communication, we can effectively
navigate disagreements and build a more cohesive and productive team.

## How to ask for coding related help

In general, please follow the [Bioconductor composing
guidelines](http://bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/#composing)
when asking for help online.

### Avoid screenshots -- use text

While a screenshot can contain a lot of information, it can make it
difficult to extract the information needed to troubleshoot the problem.

**Benefits of Text:**

-   **Clarity and Precision:** Text allows for clear and precise
    descriptions of the error, pinpointing the exact issue you\'re
    facing.
-   **Copy-Pasting Relevant Code:** Code snippets can be copied and
    pasted directly into error reports, allowing for others to
    reproduction of the problem.
-   **Searchability:** Text is searchable, making it easier for others
    to find solutions to similar errors in the future.

**What to Include:**

-   A clear and concise explanation of the error message or unexpected
    behavior you encountered.
-   Steps taken that led to the error.
-   Relevant code snippets or configurations involved.
-   Any error messages displayed verbatim.

# Responsible Conduct of Research

The Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is fundamental to the
integrity and success of scientific inquiry. As members of the
scientific community, it is our collective responsibility to uphold the
highest standards of ethics, professionalism, and integrity in all
aspects of research. This section outlines the core principles and
practices that govern our conduct within this laboratory.

## Core Principles

### Honesty and Objectivity

We strive to report data accurately and objectively, avoiding bias or
the manipulation of results. We are committed to providing truthful
representation of our research findings (i.e., avoid
[*falsification*](#falsification),
[*fabrication*](#fabrication), or
[*plagiarism*](#plagiarism)).

1.  Falsification

    Falsification entails altering or withholding research results
    (data) to bolster assertions, hypotheses, or other data. This can
    involve manipulating research instruments, materials, or procedures.
    Additionally, falsification encompasses distorting data through the
    manipulation of images or representations, including reading
    excessive meaning into the data.

    To avoid this, our lab writes all code within scripts and shares
    them using GitHub. Furthermore, all original images must be archived
    for lab access.

2.  Fabrication

    Fabrication involves creating or adding data, observations, or
    descriptions that did not genuinely arise during data collection or
    experimentation. For instance, it can happen when \"filling out\"
    additional experiment runs. It is crucial that claims regarding
    results are supported by complete datasets, as is typically
    expected. Making claims based on incomplete or assumed results
    constitutes a form of fabrication.

    To avoid fabrication, our lab keeps documentation of all raw and
    processed datasets (see **[Data Management](#data-management)**).
    During lab code review sessions, all
    team members will review the methods underlying the data. This will
    help prevent accidental data fabrication due to code errors.

3.  Plagiarism

    Plagiarism stands as one of the most prevalent forms of research
    misconduct. It\'s essential for researchers to diligently cite all
    sources and maintain meticulous notes. Using or presenting the work
    of others as one\'s own, even inadvertently, constitutes plagiarism.
    Moreover, when reviewing privileged information, such as grants or
    journal article manuscripts for peer review, researchers must
    acknowledge that such material cannot be employed for personal use
    until it is published or publicly accessible and thus cannot be
    cited.

    To help with this, our lab uses Zotero as a citation manager.
    Getting access to the citation manager is part of
    [*On-boarding*](#getting-started-in-the-heart-gen-lab).

### Data Management

Accurate and reliable data are the foundation of scientific inquiry. All
research data (raw and processed) will be meticulously documented,
organized, and stored securely. This includes code for processing the
data with detailed protocol documentation.

Experimental protocols will be published in the Methods section of our
publications, shared through GitHub, and detailed protocols via online
platforms (i.e., protocols.io, scicrunch.org, or nature protocols) to
facilitate transparency, reproducibility, and the verification of
findings by others.

To facilitate the reprocessing of raw data, we will share the developed
pipelines on GitHub and Zenodo, along with the software versions used
(as detailed in the manuscript methods). All software will be accessible
on GitHub and Zenodo, with Python tools additionally available on PyPI
and R tools on R/Bioconductor. These resources will be accessible for
download upon the initial manuscript submission. Cloud-based tools,
including Terra and Research Workbench, will be employed for efficient
data manipulation.

### Authorship

Authorship will be assigned based on contributions to the research
project. For our lab, we determine project lead(s) -- first author or
co-first authors -- at the start of every project. Every three months,
authorship will be adjusted based on contribution. For formal analysis,
this will be cross-referenced with the project\'s GitHub repository
activity and the anonymous quarterly project progression survey.

Guidelines:

1.  All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and
    all those who qualify should be listed.
2.  Authorship credit for original, research-based works (in any medium)
    may be based on:
    1.  substantial contributions to conception and design, or
        acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data;
    2.  drafting the article or revising it critically for important
        intellectual content;
    3.  sufficient participation in the work to take public
        responsibility for appropriate portions of the content;
    4.  final approval of the version to be published
3.  Acquisition of funding, collection of data (for example, from a
    fee-for-service core facility), or general supervision of the
    research group (e.g. by former or current mentors not directly
    involved in the conception or execution of the publication), alone,
    does not justify authorship.
4.  Financial and material support should be disclosed.
5.  \"Ghost-writing,\" a practice whereby a commercial entity or its
    contractor writes an article or manuscript and a scientist is listed
    as an author, is not permissible. Making minor revisions to an
    article or manuscript that is ghost-written does not justify
    authorship.
6.  AI generated text or copy-editing must be disclosed in the
    acknowledgments
7.  Copy editor(s) must be included in the acknowledgments

Our lab uses a authorship rubric to help with determine authorship and
author order. This rubric is used at the end of the project in
preparation to paper submission.

Our authorship policy follows the [ICMJE](https://www.icmje.org/)
(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) recommendations:
<https://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf>

### Conflicts of Interest

Public trust in the scientific process hinge, in part, on the
transparent handling of our relationships and activities throughout the
research lifecycle -- from planning and implementation to writing, peer
review, editing, and publication. The potential for conflicts of
interest and bias arises when professional judgment concerning a primary
interest, such as patient welfare or research validity, may be
influenced by secondary interests, like financial gain. Perceptions of
conflict of interest are as significant as actual conflicts.

Disagreements may arise regarding whether an author\'s relationships or
activities constitute conflicts. While the presence of such
relationships doesn\'t necessarily indicate problematic influence on a
paper\'s content, perceptions of conflict can undermine trust in science
as much as actual conflicts. Ultimately, readers should be empowered to
judge whether an author\'s relationships and activities are relevant to
a paper\'s content, necessitating transparent disclosures. An author\'s
full disclosure signals a commitment to transparency and bolsters trust
in the scientific process.

Financial relationships---such as employment, consultancies, stock
ownership, honoraria, patents, and paid expert testimony---are easily
identifiable and often perceived as potential conflicts of interest,
posing risks to the credibility of journals, authors, and science
itself. Other interests, including personal relationships, academic
competition, and intellectual beliefs, may also represent or be
perceived as conflicts.

Authors should refrain from agreements with study sponsors---both
for-profit and non-profit---that impede access to all study data or
hinder their ability to analyze, interpret, and publish manuscripts
independently. Policies dictating where authors may publish infringe
upon academic freedom principles. Authors may be required to share such
agreements with the journal in confidence.

Deliberately omitting relationships or activities specified on the
journal\'s disclosure form constitutes misconduct. Disclosure of
potential conflicts extends beyond direct support for the work. The
funding statement within a manuscript should only include direct support
for the described work, while individual contributions should be
attributed accordingly. Distinguishing general institutional support
from direct funding of the work ensures clarity.

For our research, we use an effort tracker to identify funding support
for each project.

### Respect for Research Participants

It is imperative that all research activities conducted within this
laboratory comply with relevant laws, regulations, and institutional
policies governing research ethics, safety, and integrity. This includes
but is not limited to protocols for human and animal subjects research,
biosafety regulations, and intellectual property rights.

When conducting research involving human subjects or animals, utmost
respect must be shown for the welfare, autonomy, and rights of those
involved. We will always obtain informed consent from human subjects and
minimize harm to animals.

### Transparency and Openness

Open and transparent communication is essential for the advancement of
science. We strive to make our methods, data, and findings accessible to
the scientific community and the public whenever possible. This includes
sharing research materials, publishing results in peer-reviewed
journals, and presenting findings at conferences. We will also generate
blog posts that are accessible to the public.
