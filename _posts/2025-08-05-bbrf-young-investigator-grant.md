## 🧠 Advancing Schizophrenia Research: Dr. Benjamin Receives 2025 BBRF Young Investigator Grant

We’re thrilled to announce that **Dr. Kynon J Benjamin** has been selected for
the **2025 Brain & Behavior Research Foundation (BBRF) Young Investigator Grant**,
one of the most competitive awards supporting early-career researchers in
neuroscience and mental health.

🧬 **Project Title:** *Unraveling cell type-specific schizophrenia risk across multiple brain regions using deconvolution*
📅 **Grant Period:** January 15, 2026 – January 14, 2028

### 🔍 Project Overview

Schizophrenia is a complex and often debilitating brain disorder with strong
genetic roots — but pinpointing exactly how risk manifests at the cellular level
remains a major challenge.

Dr. Benjamin’s research will use **state-of-the-art computational methods** to
analyze gene expression across **three critical brain regions**: the
**caudate nucleus**, **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex**, and **hippocampus**. By
deconvoluting bulk transcriptomic data, the project aims to:

- Identify **cell type-specific gene expression** changes linked to schizophrenia
- Highlight how specific gene alterations disrupt neural function
- Integrate findings with **large-scale genetic studies** to uncover actionable schizophrenia risk genes

The ultimate goal: provide a clearer roadmap for the **development of precision-based,
cell-targeted therapies** for schizophrenia.

We’re deeply honored by this recognition and excited to contribute new insights
to the field of psychiatric genomics.
