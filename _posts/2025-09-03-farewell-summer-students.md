As we start the school year, I want to make sure I take time to thank and appreciate all of our summer members. **Thank you for sharing your time and science with us and we wish you the best of luck on your next journey!**

Your curiosity, dedication, and energy made this summer unforgettable. We cannot wait to see where your next steps lead you, and we hope you carry the HEART-GeN spirit with you everywhere you go.
