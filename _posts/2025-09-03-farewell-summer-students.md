💫 **With the school year beginning, we pause to celebrate the incredible group of summer students who brought their energy, insight, and passion to the HEART-GeN Lab.**

To each of you: **thank you** for sharing your time, your science, and your unique perspectives with us. Whether you were coding models, exploring neurogenetic pathways, visualizing data, or diving into big questions about the brain — you helped shape an unforgettable season of growth, curiosity, and collaboration.

Your work made an impact, but more importantly — **you did**.

We’re so proud of everything you accomplished, and we can’t wait to see where your next steps lead. Wherever you go next, we hope you carry a piece of the HEART-GeN spirit with you: bold questions, collaborative science, and community at the core.

Here’s to the journeys ahead. 🚀  
Stay curious. Stay fearless. Stay connected.
