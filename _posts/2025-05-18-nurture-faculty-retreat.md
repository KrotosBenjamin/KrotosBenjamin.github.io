Grateful, energized, and inspired. 🌿

The **NURTURE Faculty Retreat** offered a rare and meaningful space to pause, connect, and refocus on what truly matters in academic life: **community, mentorship, and collective growth**.

Being surrounded by such passionate and dedicated researchers reminded me why initiatives like **NIH FIRST** and NURTURE were so vital — they help shape not just better science, but more inclusive and supportive environments in which that science can thrive.

💬 The conversations sparked new ideas.  
💡 The stories shared deepened our empathy.  
🤝 The connections formed will ripple forward in future collaborations.

I left feeling more hopeful than ever about the future we’re building together.
