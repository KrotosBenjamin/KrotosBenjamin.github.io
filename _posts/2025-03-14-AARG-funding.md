# HEART-GeN Receives Prestigious Grant for Alzheimer's Research

We are thrilled to announce that the **HEART-GeN Lab has been awarded a
prestigious grant from the [Alzheimer's Association](https://www.alz.org/)!**
This funding represents a major step forward in our mission to uncover the
genetic and biological mechanisms driving **health disparities in **Alzheimer's
disease and related dementias (ADRD).**

## Investigating Health Disparities in ADRD

Black Americans face **twice the risk of developing dementia** and a **50%**
**higher stroke risk** compared to their white counterparts -- disparities
driven by both genetic and environmental factors. However, historical housing
policies and socioeconomic inequities complicate efforts to disentangle these
influences at the molecular level.

Our research leverages **genetic admixture in Black Americans (primarily
African and European ancestries)** to dissect ancestry-driven genetic effects.
Previous studies from our lab identified a key role for **immune and vascular
pathways** in ancestry-related gene expression differences -- pathways
critical in stroke and Alzheimer's disease. However, aging, the primary risk
factor for ADRD, was not fully explored in this context.

## Our Research Goals

This pilot study will explore the molecular connections between **genetic
ancestry, aging, and dementia** by:

- Examine how genetic ancestry affects age-related gene expression changes
- Analyze genetic variants linked to ADRD risk using bulk and single-nuclei
  expression data
- Identify ancestry-related risk genes by using traditional and deep
  learning-based genetic models

Through this work, we seek to **prioritize ADRD risk genes and cell types,**
particularly those involved in immune pathways, ultimately **paving the way
for more targeted therapeutics**

## A Milestone for HEART-GeN

This grant is more than just funding -- it's **a powerful endorsement of the
urgency of address health disparities in ADRD.** We are incredibly grateful to
the **Alzheimer's Association** for their support and commitment to advancing
research in this critical area.

We look forward to sharing updates as we embark on this next phase of research.
