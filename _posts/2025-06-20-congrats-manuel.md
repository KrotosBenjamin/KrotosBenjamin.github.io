🎓 **A big congratulations to Manuel** on graduating with his master’s degree in **Data Science**!  

Manuel began his graduate journey with a passion for data and a vision for impact — and we’ve had the pleasure of seeing that vision come to life. He joined the **HEART-GeN Lab** as a data analyst during his program and quickly became an essential part of our research efforts.

We’re thrilled to share that Manuel will **continue working with us in his role as data analyst**, helping drive forward our work at the intersection of neuroscience, genetics, and computational biology.

Your dedication, technical skill, and thoughtful contributions have already made a difference — and we’re excited to see what we’ll accomplish together next. Congratulations again, Manuel! 🎉
