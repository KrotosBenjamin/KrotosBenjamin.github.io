# HEART-GeN Lab at ABRCMS 2025

We had an incredible week at **ABRCMS 2025** in *San Antonio, TX*! The HEART-GeN
Lab came out in full force, and I’m proud to share some of the many highlights
from this inspiring, energizing, and impactful conference.

## 🔁 Then & Now: Full Circle Moment

Last year, I attended **ABRCMS 2024** as a recipient of a **Judges Travel Award**.
This year, I returned — not alone, but with **six outstanding undergraduate
researchers** from our lab, all presenting their original work.

This full-circle moment was a powerful reminder of how mentorship, opportunity,
and community can shape the next generation of scientists.

## 🔬 Undergraduate Research on Display

Over the course of three packed days, our lab delivered **5 poster presentations
and 1 oral talk** — all led by undergraduate researchers. Here’s a breakdown of
the incredible work they shared:

### 📅 Thursday

**🧠 Emma Tsai** (*SROP 2025*)
**Poster:** *Schizophrenia and suicide risk: computational insights*
- **Track:** Computational Biology
- Emma received a **Travel Award** to attend ABRCMS and will be starting **medical school** next year!

## 🧑🏽‍⚖️ Judging & Service

I also had the pleasure of serving as a **poster judge** in Computational
Biology on both Thursday and Friday. A huge thank you to the **Judges Leads**
(Bolaji Thomas, Jeanette Papp, and Dana Crawford) for running such an organized
and engaging process.

It’s always a privilege to support emerging scientists and learn from the next
wave of ideas in our field.

## 🎭 Lab Bonding & Wicked: For Good

After a full Friday of science, we wrapped the evening with a **lab dinner** and
saw *Wicked: For Good* together in San Antonio. It was the perfect way to
celebrate a week of hard work, growth, and collaboration.

## 🧪 Final Reflections

ABRCMS 2025 was a vivid reminder of why we do what we do — to create space,
opportunity, and belonging in science.

I left the conference deeply inspired by the brilliance of our students, the
generosity of this community, and the promise of the future they’re building.

Thank you to everyone who made this experience possible.
