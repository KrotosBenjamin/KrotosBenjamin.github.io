## 🏓 Teamwork and Friendly Competition

We gathered for a lab-wide ping pong showdown and the energy was unbeatable. The paddles were flying, the cheers were loud, and it was the perfect break to celebrate our teamwork.

## 🏆 Honoring Our March Madness Winners

During the event, **Dr. Benjamin** presented our March Madness winners with their well-earned gifts — and he crushed everyone on the **Women's Bracket** along the way.
