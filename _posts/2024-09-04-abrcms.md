Exciting news for HEART-GeN Lab as Dr. Benjamin is awarded the
[Travel Judge award](https://www.abrcms.org/present-at-abrcms/apply-for-a-travel-award/#judge) for the
[Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minoritized Scientists](https://www.abrcms.org/)
(ABRCMS). This award will allow Dr. Benjamin to attend the upcoming conference this
November as a judge for the first time. 

ABRCMS seeks to “encourage minority, first-generation, veteran, and disabled students to
pursue higher education in STEM.” In this mission, ABRCMS hosts a hybrid conference, an
ePoster Spring Symposium for Emerging Scientists, a graduate symposium, and ABRCMS365.
These offerings give underserved scientists a way to engage with scientific research that
is not routinely offered.  

Thank you to ABRCMS for the work that you do. Dr. Benjamin is excited to give back to his
community by mentoring young scientists at this conference. He particularly looks forward
to attending the meetings in person this year and is eager to engage with the inspiring
work that will be showcased.
