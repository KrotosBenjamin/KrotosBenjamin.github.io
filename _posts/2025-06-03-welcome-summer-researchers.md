🌟 Meet the HEART-GeN Lab Summer Research Team – 2025 Edition! 🌟

We’re thrilled to welcome a powerhouse group of students diving into cutting-edge questions at the intersection of **genetics, neuroscience, and computational biology**. Each one brings unique perspectives and skills to the lab, and we couldn’t be more excited to support their journey.

Here’s what our talented summer researchers will be working on:

- 🧬 **Nia** (SROP) investigating **DNA methylation clocks** to uncover associations across two postmortem brain regions, focusing on **schizophrenia** and **genetic ancestry**.

- 🧠 **Emma** (SROP) exploring the relationship between **schizophrenia and suicide** by analyzing three distinct postmortem brain regions — helping us better understand overlapping neurobiological pathways.

- 💻 **Amirah**, a returning bioscientist student, developing a **Shiny App** to visualize and explore **differential gene expression** — a powerful tool for future collaborators.

- 🌱 **Elisa**, our summer volunteer, working with staff scientist **Alexis** to examine **DNA methylation as a proxy for environmental exposures** in three postmortem brain regions.

- 🔗 **Javier** (SURP) applying **variational autoencoders (VAEs)** to construct **gene-gene networks**, contributing to our efforts in uncovering novel functional relationships.

- 🌐 **Yiju**, our fully remote intern, focused on annotating **functional genetic variants** identified in our prior studies — bridging the gap between raw discovery and biological insight.

Together, this group exemplifies what happens when **curiosity meets collaboration**. We’re proud to support their growth as scientists, and we can't wait to see where their ideas take them next.
