# Exciting Growth at HEART-GeN: Welcoming Christina, Alexis, and Manuel!

We are thrilled to kick off this month by extending a **warm and heartfelt**
**welcome** to three exceptional individuals who joined our research family
last month! Please join us in welcoming **Christina**, **Alexis**, and
**Manuel** to the HEART-GeN Lab. Their arrival strengthens our commitment to
advancing personalized medicine and improving therapeutics for under-researched
communities.

At HEART-GeN, our mission is to explore how **genetic ancestry influences**
**neurological disorders**, particularly in tissues like the brain that are most
relevant to these conditions. By deepening our understanding of these
connections, we aim to drive more effective and equitable treatments for
everyone.

Each of our new team members brings unique expertise and fresh perspectives to
this work. We are excited to see how their contributions will enrich our
collaborative research efforts and push the boundaries of scientific discovery.
Their passion for impactful research aligns perfectly with our vision, and we
can't wait to embark on this journey together.

Please join us in giving Christina, Alexis, and Manuel a warm welcome to the
HEART-GeN family! In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing more about their roles
and contributions -- stay tuned.

**Welcome to the HEART-GeN family!**
