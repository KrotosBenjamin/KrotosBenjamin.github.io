Thrilled to have had the chance to present our latest research at **#BoG2025** this year! 🧬🧠
Our poster introduced `RFMix-reader` for processing local ancestry data from `RFMix` using GPU-acceleration. It was incredible to see how much interest this work sparked, especially from those working with machine learning and local ancestry.

Events like BoG remind me why we do this work: not just to publish, but to connect, challenge, and co-create new knowledge.

Thanks to everyone who stopped by to discuss, question, and share insights. Excited to see where this momentum leads next.
