🎉 **Please join us in giving a warm welcome to Sula**, the very first **graduate student** to join the **HEART-GeN Lab**!  

Sula is launching her graduate journey with a bold mission: to uncover the **genetic risk factors underlying Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias**, and help illuminate the biological pathways that drive **neurodegeneration**. 🧠🧬  

Before joining HEART-GeN, Sula gained valuable experience working at a **brain bank**, where she studied the visible effects of dementia in postmortem tissue. That experience deeply shaped her passion for understanding the science behind memory loss, aging, and neurobiology.

Outside the lab, Sula brings creativity, curiosity, and adventure to everything they do. From **playing the piano** and **gardening** to **painting**, **hiking**, and **traveling**, Sula embodies the kind of multidimensional thinking we value so deeply in science.

We are beyond excited to support your growth, ideas, and impact as a scholar. Welcome to the team, Sula — the future of neuroscience is in good hands.
