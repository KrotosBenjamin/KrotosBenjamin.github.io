HEART-GeN Lab is excited to welcome Sula to our team! 🧠 Sula's area of focus is in searching for the genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's and other dementias to discover the mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease.

🔬 Sula has worked at a brain bank where they learned about different dementias and saw their effect on post mortem brains.

🎨 When not in the lab, Sula is an artist and explorer at heart. Sula's hobbies include playing piano, gardening, painting, hiking, and traveling.

We are thrilled to have you on board, Sula, and cannot wait to see the impact of your work!
