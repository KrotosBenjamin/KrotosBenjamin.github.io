I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be joining Northwestern University Feinberg

I'm honored to join this esteemed institution and contribute to the fields of
neurogenomics and health disparities. I'm also excited to be part of the
[NIH FIRST](https://commonfund.nih.gov/FIRST) (Faculty Institutional Recruitment

This opportunity represents a significant milestone in my career, and I'm
looking forward to collaborating with brilliant colleagues, mentoring students,
and improving therapeutics for under-researched communities.

I'm grateful for the support of my mentors, colleagues, friends, and family who
have helped me reach this point. Here's to new beginnings and making a positive
impact in mental health!
