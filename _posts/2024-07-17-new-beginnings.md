I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be joining Northwestern University Feinberg
School of Medicine as an Assistant Professor at in the [Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences](https://www.psychiatry.northwestern.edu/) starting September 1st!

I'm honored to join this esteemed institution and contribute to the fields of
neurogenomics and health disparities. I'm also excited to be part of the
[NIH FIRST](https://commonfund.nih.gov/FIRST) (Faculty Institutional Recruitment
for Sustainable Transformation) [NURTURE](https://nurture.northwestern.edu/)
program at Northwestern, which aims to enhance diversity in biomedical research.

This opportunity represents a significant milestone in my career, and I'm
looking forward to collaborating with brilliant colleagues, mentoring students,
and improving therapeutics for under-researched communities.

I'm grateful for the support of my mentors, colleagues, friends, and family who
have helped me reach this point. Here's to new beginnings and making a positive
impact in mental health!
