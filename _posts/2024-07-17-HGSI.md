We are honored to share that Dr. Benjamin has been selected as a Human Genetic Scholar
in the 2024-2026 cohort. This prestigious award is presented by the
[American Society of Human Genetics](https://www.ashg.org/about/) (ASHG) and seeks to
uplift early career genetic scientists from traditionally underserved backgrounds.

Dr. Benjamin is deeply passionate about working towards a more inclusive future,
especially in science, and is very excited to engage with other scientists with a
similar mission. As part of this award, Dr. Benjamin will participate in the next two
annual ASHG meetings, collaborate with an ASHG mentor, and engage in ongoing career
development training.

A very warm thank you to ASHG for the opportunity; we look forward to the next two years
and beyond.
