## 🧬 Breaking New Ground at ASHG 2025

Our team had the honor of contributing to the **American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2025 Annual Meeting** in **Boston, MA** (October 14–18, 2025) — one of the premier international gatherings in genomics.

### 🧪 Poster Presentation

**Alexis Bennett** presented a compelling research poster on **DNA methylation heritability**, offering novel insights into how genetic variation influences epigenetic signatures. Her work adds critical context to understanding gene regulation and its implications for disease risk.

### 🎤 Career Development Panel: "Starting a Lab, Then vs Now"

**Dr. Kynon J Benjamin** was featured as a panelist in a professional development session addressing the evolving challenges and opportunities of launching an academic research lab.

**Panelists:**
- Dr. Brittany Lasseigne (UAB Heersink School of Medicine)  
- Dr. Michael Talkowski (Massachusetts General Hospital)  
- *(In absentia:)* Dr. Vidhu Thaker (Columbia University Irving Medical Center)  
- **Moderator:** Dr. Martin Bruess (University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus)

🧠 The panel highlighted diverse paths to academic faculty positions and strategies for navigating starting a new research group in today’s research environment.

We’re energized by the conversations, collaborations, and scientific progress shared at ASHG 2025 — and proud to represent the values of curiosity, inclusion, and impact in human genetics.
