## 🧬 Breaking New Ground at ASHG 2025

Our team had the honor of contributing to the **American Society of Human
Genetics (ASHG) 2025 Annual Meeting** in **Boston, MA** (October 14–18, 2025) —
one of the premier international gatherings in genomics.

### 🧪 Poster Presentation

**Alexis Bennett** presented a compelling research poster on **DNA methylation
heritability**, offering novel insights into how genetic variation influences
epigenetic signatures. Her work adds critical context to understanding gene
regulation and its implications for disease risk.

### 🎤 Career Development Panel: "Starting a Lab, Then vs Now"

We’re proud to share that **Dr. Kynon J Benjamin** served as a panelist in a
dynamic career development session at **ASHG 2025**, focused on the evolving
landscape of launching and leading an academic research lab.

He was joined by outstanding panelists — **Dr. Brittany Lasseigne** (UAB
Heersink School of Medicine) and **Dr. Michael Talkowski** (Massachusetts
General Hospital) — for a lively and insightful discussion on navigating today’s
academic environment, from securing faculty positions to building sustainable
research programs.

The session sparked thoughtful questions from the audience and meaningful
dialogue on mentorship, funding, and leadership. A big thank-you to **Dr. Martin
Bruess** (University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus) for moderating, and we
hope to connect with **Dr. Vidhu Thaker** (Columbia University Irving Medical
Center) at a future event.

We left the session feeling inspired by the conversations, connections, and
momentum in human genetics — and proud to represent the values of curiosity,
inclusion, and impact.

### 🎉 PacBio Celebration with Friends

In between sessions, **Dr. Benjamin** joined friends for the PacBio event — a
great chance to connect, laugh, and celebrate the week together.
